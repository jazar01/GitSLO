I am on the war path against spam.  This repository is my work space for spam fighting tools. 

I have had the same work email address for 14 years.  It was posted on our company website for several years. 
My job title and bio are on my company website and everyone that has something to sell to IT wants to spam me.
I have been to numerous conferences and tradeshows.  I have purchased a lot of products and services.   

Way too many companies and marketing people think it is just fine to send marketing email to anyone whos 
email address they can obtain.  Hey marketing people: it is not ok to send me email just because I bought 
something, or attended a tradeshow, or a webinar, or downloade a whitepaper, ...  Just because you required
my email address to register for your event doesn't mean you can put me on your mail list!  Just because I
bought your product, doesn't mean I want to hear about everything else you have to offer.

The latest trend is to send an unsolicied email, then follow up in a week, then again every week, or every day.
I used to ingore them until I got a few emails from the same source.  Now I block the email address of every 
unsolicited offer on the very first first message. Same goes for everyone that emails me that I don't already know. 

I am stepping up the battle now and I am going to block the entire domain of every company that sends me
unsolicted email.  I currently have about 125,000 email addresses and domains on my block list.  Most of them 
are individual email addresses.  I also have a pretty good sized whitelist of people and domains that I want
to receive mail from.  

My white and black list are actually fairly effective.  But they are getting too big and unweildy.  One of the
things I want to optimize is the ability to blacklist domains.  One of the first utilties that I am working
here is the ability to review my whitelist and blacklist with some automatic identification of which entries are 
from public email domains and which are from companies or private domains.  If an address is from a public domain,
like gmail.com or aol.com, it wouldn't be a good idea to whitelist or blacklist the entire domain.  All others need
to be reviewed.  Any company that I actually like and doesn't send me crap email and invitations, I will whitelist
the entire company not just individuals.  On the flip side, if I get a spam email or request for meeting or 
invitation to a webinar, ..., from a company or domain that I don't give explicit permission; the entire domain is getting
blocked.

My yet-to-be-named utility will allow me to review my whitelist and blacklist and quickly check off on whether to block
or allow just the sender or the entire domain.  There will be some smarts to help quickly sort and optmize my lists,
along with some helpful information to identify problems.  Such as entries that are both allowed and blocked, and other
clues that an entry deserves attention.

Btw: I am not stopping here.  Stay tuned.  I have a couple of other things in mind that I will also develop.  
My spam problem is very bad.  I am confident that I have the right ideas to elimiate my problem.  What I am 
doing may help some of you too.

This project is primarly my workspace to solve my own problem and not necessarily intended to be the worldwide
spam killer.  But feel free to comment and ask questions.  NOTE this project does not have a complete and
working deliverable yet.
